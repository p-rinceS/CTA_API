Every day is a learning day.

This is my first experience at creating a usable & public API.
Inspired by [Nordic APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaKg5TOB1pw).
And followed some tutorials to get started.. Gotta start [somewhere..](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZMpbdK0uqU)

    My goal is to create an API that could allow developers to easily access public CTA data such as:
    
    1) List of all stops of certain bus/line.
    
    2) Times of certain bus/trains. (Possibly live updates since CTA is so unreliable....)
    
    3) Routes/Maps of buses & trains.
    
    4) Information on fare prices & payment options.
    
    
I'm optimistic so we'll see how far we get.. ðŸ˜Š
